                                <p>Limbo is a puzzle-platform video game developed by independent studio Playdead. Limbo is a 2D side-scroller, incorporating a physics system that governs environmental objects and the player character. The player guides
                                    an unnamed boy through dangerous environments and traps as he searches for his sister. The game is presented in black-and-white tones, using lighting, film grain effects and minimal ambient sounds to create an eerie
                                    atmosphere often associated with the horror genre. This is the perfect game for someone who doesn't like happy endings. </p>

                                <p>Slender: The Eight Pages (formerly called Slender) is a free-to-play indie-developed first-person survival horror video game released in June 2012 as a beta for Microsoft Windows and OS X by Parsec Productions. The game
                                    is based on the quasi-folklore meme figure known as the Slender Man, who is depicted as a tall man wearing all black with a white face with no facial features. The character is known for the ominous (although fictitious)
                                    abduction of countless children in dark mysterious settings, such as deep forests and abandoned buildings.</p>

                                <p>INSIDE is a puzzle-platformer adventure game developed and published by Playdead. The player character is an unnamed boy who explores a surreal and mostly monochromatic environment presented as a 2.5D platform game. The
                                    game is dark, with color used sparingly to highlight both the player and certain parts of the environment. The game is also mostly silent, with the exception of occasional musical cues. The player controls the boy who
                                    walks, runs, swims, climbs, and uses objects to overcome obstacles and progress in the game.</p>
